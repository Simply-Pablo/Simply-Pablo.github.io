                            selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle royale to the death

                            Edward Cullen. Bella moves to the small and rainy town of Forks, Washington, to live with
                            her father after her mother remarries. She hates the rain, but at least she fits in better
                            in Forks than she did in her huge high school in Phoenix, Arizona.</td>
